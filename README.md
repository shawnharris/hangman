# hangmanProgram
# This was a homework assignment that I took a little too far :) 
# This is a pretty simple game. It is hangman and the words are pulled from a text file included in the project. I'm new at this, but make # sure the words.txt file is accessible.

# This is coded using Python 3.6.
# Welcoming feedback and advice on how to make my code writing better!
